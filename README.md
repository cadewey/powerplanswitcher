# Power Plan Switcher

*Switching between power plans on Windows was never easier.*

This is a fork of https://github.com/cdetamble/powerplanswitcher, a nifty little tool that runs as a system tray application in the background and allows for a quick switching between power plans that are configured in Windows.

For example, you can configure a power saver plan that reduces the CPU speed to 5% (as can be seen in the gif below) and quickly switch to it whenever you want to save some battery power.

Please note that the main and only purpose of this tool is to *switch* between plans and not to *configure* them. This has to be done beforehand in the Power Options menu in Windows.
